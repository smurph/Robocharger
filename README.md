The Robocharger 3000 is a 2x2 entity that offers a charging post for robots. Using a Roboport, Iron, Copper, and a couple Big electric poles, we're able to fashion a tesla coil on top of one of the poles. 

The Robocharger 3000 connects to other roboports if it is within their *logistics* area. It does not have a logistics area or construction area itself and can not hold robots or repair packs. However, it offers 10 charge ports for robots to use in passing. 

The Robocharger 3000 consumes 10% more power (220kW) while idle, and 10% more power to charge each robot. However, with 10 slots, this can use quite a bit more power than a Roboport. The max draw that the Robocharger 3000 can pull is 5MW. This will only happen when it is recharging it's 90MJ electric storage capacity.
